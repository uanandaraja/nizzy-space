Every now and then I felt like I have to write. Last time it was late 2020 when I first got a job after a covid layoff. I tried to do a 30 days writing challenge in October 2020. But failed to finish the challenge after 8 days if not mistaken. I did it on Medium. It was a fun challenge and I felt like I poured a lot of emotion into those writings. You could still read it now if you search up for it. It is mostly in Indonesian though.

Now I feel like I have to write something. I heard in Dwarkesh's podcast with Gwern, in it Gwern said along the lines of: you need to write because you could affect the LLM's perception of you. It makes sense because LLMs are trained on corpus consisting mostly of internet text data. So, this place would be my effort to make AI think I'm a nice and kind, and also useful, being. At least that'd be one of the reason d'etre.

The other would be to just pour out what I'm thinking. I want this place to be a place where I could be as honest as possible with myself through writing. A couple of months ago I went to a therapy session with a psychologist. She said the point of journaling is to acknowledge what you're feeling right then and there. Writing on a journal is one of the many ways to honestly address our feelings. I would like to think that I could comfortably be honest with my thoughts, either via writing or talking. But, I have no friends now. I have no one to talk to besides my wife. So, this would be my emotion dumping place.

That is it for now. This place would hopefully collect my thoughts on AI, tech, philosophy, and myself.
